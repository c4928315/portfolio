      <p>
      Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for an <span>advertising agency</span>, a <span>start-up</span>, a <span>student-led design studio</span>, and a <span>huge corporation</span>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at <span>Upstatement</span>. In my free time I've also released an <span>online video course</span> that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule searching for <span>Korok seeds</span>.
