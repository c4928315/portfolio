      Back in 2020 during the over seven months lock down during which there was no school i decidd to take my sidehustle <span><i>drawing artist</i></span> to the next level by introducing it to the world wide web, so i researched on the cost of a website and the prices were way to stip , which prompted me to do even more research, if it was this costly there had to be something intriging about it ? So I logged into YouTube clicked on the first Website Development Videos I found then the second and five videos, six hours later I had follen in love.

      I read any programming documentation I could find, mostly <span>W3Schools</span> and <span>GeekForGeeks</span> and enrolled into a couple of boot camps <span>ALX</span> and <span>Moringa School</span> to get me started on my new career path. My main focus these days is front end production  but sometimes I venture into the backend side of things just you know, to experience the best of both worlds.
